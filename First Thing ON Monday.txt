Problem Statement::

Muhammad, we are ready to start the template building.
Your goal is to create generalized template notebook files that are well documented, usable and understandable for no-code users, 
and works across any relevant dataset. For now, we are waiting on the release of our new SDK, so we want to have you start by 
writing them only in python notebook without the rapidcanvas SDK. These functions should take in a data frame and whichever 
other parameters needed to accomplish the goal. The two we want you to start with are the following:

 Drop Columns - Should be able to remove any column by name or index, multiple at the same time and/or by some condition (Ex. Columns that are null)
 Delete Rows - Should be able to remove any row by index, multiple at the same time and/or by some condition (Ex. Remove rows where some value is null)

Please throughly test these functions and document their usage- when you are done we will have you next week start using the new SDK to make these work inside of RapidCanvas.

Is it clear?
